# Cyric263.github.io

=== Welcome to my README.md :)

My github page, https://cyric263.github.io/, is divided into 3 sections:

1. notebook: computing notes on things I tend to forget how to do.  Topics like how to use vim, image back up for windows and linux, and how to use github from terminal.

2. thespaceship: notes and snippets from some of the books, channelings, and deep hypnosis content I enjoy.

3. polycarbonsuit: notes on topics like: A Course In Miracles, Aliens, and Readings. (this section needs to be revised).
